# Networking
Various client-server programs written in Python. Requests are verified to be working by using Wireshark, and images are included as further proof.

### Assignment 1
Uses TCP to establish a basic connection between the client and server on separate machines.

### Assignment 2
Uses TCP for the server to receive the request "What is the current date and time?" and then send the correct response to the client.

### Assignment 3
Uses UDP to send and receive packets between server and client. Uses the rdt2.2 process for reliability: includes error handling for mismatched checksums, out of order sequence numbers, and duplicate acknowledgements.

### Assignment 4
Uses UDP to send and receive packets between server and client. Uses the rdt3.0 process for reliability: includes error handling for mismatched checksums, out of order sequence numbers, duplicate acknowledgements, and packet timeouts.
